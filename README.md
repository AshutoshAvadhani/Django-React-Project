# Django-React-Project
This is going to be a Django-React project where I am experimenting with React concepts and Django Concepts for the first time. 
I am creating a music app which will allow people to vote and play music together.
I would be consuming Spotify-API to allow people to add music in the queue and allow the user to skip the song if they do not like it.
