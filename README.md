# Django-React-Project
This is going to be a Django-React project where I am experimenting with React concepts and Django Concepts for the first time. 
I am creating a music app which will allow people to vote to skip the songs. If the number of votes reahes a certain threshold then that song will be skipped.
I would be consuming Spotify-API to allow people to add music in the queue and django to handle the backend connections and server requirements.
